This is a testimonials project to practice grid, and responsive web with grid.

* I have to fix :
   - the content streching out of the grid, when - desktop version and mobile version - screen reaches up to 80% zoom. 

   - features to work for all browsers

   - resizing according to body-- so that the grid is centered
  
  - font-size
